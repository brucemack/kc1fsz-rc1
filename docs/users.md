# Software Defined Repeater Controller - User Guide

This is the user guide for the [W1TKZ Software Defined Repeater Controller](https://github.com/brucemack/kc1fsz-rc1). Please contact KC1FSZ with any questions or corrections.

## Firmware Flash Update (Local via USB)

The controller board comes with the firmware installed. There may be 
instances when the firmware needs to be updated. The Pico architecture
makes firmware updates easy:

* Disconnect the digital board from the radio interface board.
* Connect a USB micro cable to the connector on the Pico Pi 2. 
* Hold down the BOOTSEL button on the Pico and plug the USB cable into a computer.
* The Pico should appear as a USB-connected storage device.
* Copy/drag the main.uf2 file into the root folder of the Pico.
* The controller should restart with the new firmware.
* Connect to the console interface (see below), enter the command shell,
and use the version command to validate the firmware version.
* Configuration settings may need to be re-applied after a firmware flash.

## Connectors

### Power Connector

Standard 5.5mm power connector. +12VDC on center pin.

### DB25 Radio Connector

The radios connect via a DB25 (female) connector.  The pinout should 
look a bit familiar to users of the SCOM-7000.

|-----|-------------------------|----|
| 1   | Radio 0 audio in (10k立) | I  |

| 5   | Radio 0 CTCSS           | I  |
| 6   | Radio 1 CTCSS           | I  |
| 7   | NC                      |    |

| 15  | Radio 1 audio out (600立)| O  |
| 16  | NC                      |    |
| 17  | NC                      |    |
| 18  | NC                      |    |
| 19  | Ground                  |    |
| 20  | Ground                  |    |
| 21  | Ground                  |    |
| 22  | Ground                  |    |
| 23  | NC                      |    |
| 24  | NC                      |    |
| 25  | NC                      |    |

NOTES:
* The terms "audio in" and "audio out" should be interpreted from the perspective of the controller. The audio in pins take audio from a receiver and the audio out pins deliver audio to a transmitter.
* Audio in and out pins have DC blocking capacitors.
* Audio out pins support 0 to 1.5Vpp into a 600 ohm load. 
* The COS/CTCSS are 5V logic inputs. The software allows the polarity of these controls to be configured to support positive or negative logic (depending on radio)
* The PTT pins are open collector to ground *and can sink at most 50mA*.  Please plan accordingly if your transmitter PTT circuit involves a larger current requirement (i.e. mechanical relays, etc.)

### USB Connector

Male, USB-A. For console connection. Runs at 115,200 baud.

## Board Adjustments

All radios operate with different audio levels and at different impedances.
The 4 hardware gain controls are used to adjust receive and transmit audio levels
to make best use of the dynamic range of the controller. These hardware adjustments 
should be made during initial installation. Fine adjustments can be made to the 
audio level using the soft gain controls.

![Board Adjustments](trims.jpg)

Use the test tone feature to generate a continuous transmit tone to adjust the transmit levels.

Use the receive level meter on the console to adjust the receive levels.

## Console Interface 

The console interface is accessed via the serial USB connection or via the LoRa 
link (in development). The console is accessed using a serial terminal program
that supports VT100 emulation. minicom (Linux, MacOS) and Putty (Windows) have been
used successfully. Other would work I'm sure.

The console operates in three modes, each described below.

### Log Mode

The controller boots into log mode. Log mode displays a continuously scrolling list
of timestamped controller activity messages.

For example:

        I: 000000:05.039 Transmitter keyed [0]                                  
        I: 000000:05.040 Transmitter keyed [1]                                  
        I: 000000:06.041 CWID start W1TKZ                                       
        I: 000000:06.044 CWID start W1TKZ                                       
        I: 000000:09.528 CWID end                                               
        I: 000000:09.531 CWID end                                               
        I: 000000:10.529 Transmitter unkeyed [0]                                
        I: 000000:10.532 Transmitter unkeyed [1]

### Status Mode

Status mode displays a real-time dashboard of controller status. For example:
